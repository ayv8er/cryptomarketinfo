# Cryptocurrency Market Index

## Description
A React SPA that consumes and displays a 3rd party API (CoinGecko) into a main table, with the ability to select certain currencies to place into another favorites table. 

## Contributions
Implemented Redux to manage state of both the main table index and the favorites table. Also programmed a custom hook to set dark mode to local storage.
