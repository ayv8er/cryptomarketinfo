# Cryptocurrency Market Index

## Description
A React SPA that consumes and displays a 3rd party API (CoinGecko) into a main table, with the ability to select certain currencies to place into another favorites table. 

## Contributions
Implemented Redux to manage state of both the main table index and the favorites table. Also programmed a custom hook to set dark mode to local storage. CSS Design is via React Bootstrap. Login and Registration is handled by Yup and Formik. After login, user state is manged with Redux while the JWT is set to local storage.  Users favorites table does not currently persist. I'm working on that.
